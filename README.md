ap-transclude
=============

AngularJS transclusion on steroids.


Why?
====

Because [named slots for transclusion](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/11/16/multiple-transclusion-and-named-slots.html) were introduced only in AngularJS 1.5.x, while are needed by many projects that use older versions of AngularJS. `ap-translude` does provide similar functionality for AngularJS 1.3.x.
